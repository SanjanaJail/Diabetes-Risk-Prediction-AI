# 🩺 Diabetes Risk Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on building an intelligent **Diabetes Risk Prediction System** using machine learning techniques to assist in early detection and preventive healthcare decision-making. The system analyzes key clinical and lifestyle parameters to predict an individual’s risk of developing diabetes and provides interpretable insights using explainable AI techniques.

The project is designed with both **technical robustness** and **real-world healthcare usability** in mind.
